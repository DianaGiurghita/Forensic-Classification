Immediate fixes (for paper deadline):
- G: add a help message to easly install ggthemr (i.e. by using  devtools::install_github('cttobin/ggthemr')) 
- G: errors in "plots" if I use diamonds 
- T: make a list of package versions for which the app works as intended and enforce that before app run
	- T: numerical data summaries not working for Tereza
- T: tables: rounding numbers in tables (up to 3 digits or whatever is relevant)
- T: add other relevant logos from Eugenio
- T: cv options: training percentages should be realistic (over 100% should not be accepted)
- T: add relevant error messages for the user when things go wrong
- [FIXED] G: several errors in "Classification Performance" (only with Alcohol.txt)
- [FIXED] G: errors in "Classification Performance" (Performance measures by class) if I use diabetes 
- [FIXED] classification summary not working as intended
- [ADDED] classification plot that shows training data, testing data and misclassified observations
- [ADDED] LR calculations for predicted data in the classification tab [for binary data only]
- [FIXED] G: It isn't possible to delete and/or change a predictor once it has been choosen - select and use delete button


Additional fixes/features for later:
- additional methods for classification: knn, naive Bayes, random forests, neural networks etc.
- use plotly for interactive graphics 
- T: redesign menu so that each tab has the relevant options to that tab only (prevent long pages due to many options in leftside menu)
