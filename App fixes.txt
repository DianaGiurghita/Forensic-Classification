Immediate fixes (for paper deadline):
- G: add a help message to easly install ggthemr (i.e. by using  devtools::install_github('cttobin/ggthemr')) 
- T: make a list of package versions for which the app works as intended and enforce that before app run
- D: glmnet estimation problems	
- D: add prediction for new data in the LR tab
- T: add other relevant logos from Eugenio
- T: app crashing when using multivariate lr
- T: In the Likelihood ratio tab, when I choose all three methods the results only list bayes and net. Surely one of those should be firth?
- D: diabetes does not work with Firth logistic regression
- T: we should be able to compare methods in the Likelihood ratio tab and the Classification tab: make the training set the same and option to use the same seed?
- [ADDED] D: make an averages table for the Likelihood ratio comparison
- [ADDED] T: allow classification method running with training set to 100% (i.e. the whole data set is used for fitting the model)
- [FIXED] T: numerical data summaries not working for Tereza
- [FIXED] T: In the cross-validation options, if I make the training percentage 100% I get a warning, but the model still runs.
- [FIXED] T: cv options: training percentages should be realistic (over 100% or negative should not be accepted)
- [FIXED] T: tables: rounding numbers in tables (up to 3 digits or whatever is relevant)
- [ADDED] T: add relevant error messages for the user when things go wrong
- [FIXED] G: errors in "plots" if I use diamonds 
- [FIXED] T: tables too long - added horizontal scrolling for tables that are too long
- [FIXED] G: several errors in "Classification Performance" (only with Alcohol.txt)
- [FIXED] G: errors in "Classification Performance" (Performance measures by class) if I use diabetes 
- [FIXED] classification summary not working as intended
- [ADDED] classification plot that shows training data, testing data and misclassified observations
- [ADDED] LR calculations for predicted data in the classification tab [for binary data only]
- [FIXED] G: It isn't possible to delete and/or change a predictor once it has been chosen - select and use delete button


Additional fixes/features for later:
- additional methods for classification: knn, naive Bayes, random forests, neural networks etc.
- use plotly for interactive graphics 
- create color palette for plots to allow for large numbers of levels in a categorical variable
- [FIXED] T: redesign menu so that each tab has the relevant options to that tab only (prevent long pages due to many options in leftside menu)
- check warnings when using Glass: "Warning in confusionMatrix.default(reference = as.factor(ClassRes$testing_dataset[,  :
  Levels are not in the same order for reference and data. Refactoring data to match."
