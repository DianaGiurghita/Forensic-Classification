Immediate fixes (for paper deadline):
- [FIXED] classification summary not working as intended
- [ADDED] classification plot that shows training data, testing data and misclassified observations
- [ADDED] LR calculations for predicted data in the classification tab [for binary data only]



Additional fixes/features for later:
- additional methods for classification: knn, naive Bayes, random forests, neural networks etc.
- use plotly for interactive graphics
