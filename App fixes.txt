Immediate fixes (for paper deadline):
- to add an help message to easly install ggthemr (i.e. by using  devtools::install_github('cttobin/ggthemr')) 
- several errors in "Classification Performance" (only with Alcohol.txt)
- errors in "plots" if I use diamonds 
- errors in "Classification Performance" (Performance measures by class) if I use diabetes 
- [FIXED] classification summary not working as intended
- [ADDED] classification plot that shows training data, testing data and misclassified observations
- [ADDED] LR calculations for predicted data in the classification tab [for binary data only]
- [FIXED] It isn't possible to delete and/or change a predictor once it has been choosen - select and use delete button


Additional fixes/features for later:
- additional methods for classification: knn, naive Bayes, random forests, neural networks etc.
- use plotly for interactive graphics
